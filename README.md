## **Overview**

ScribeVoice transforms your voice into notes, transcripts, lists and more with AI. Powered by OpeanAI, it uses the latest model to give you the best possible output!

## **Technologies**

This template leverages a modern tech stack for a smooth developer experience:

- **Programming Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ‚Äì Ensures type safety and better maintainability.
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ‚Äì The leading React framework for hybrid static & server-side rendering.
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) ‚Äì Optimized for seamless, serverless deployment.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äì Utility-first CSS for rapid styling.
- **Linting & Formatting**:
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ‚Äì Enforces code quality and best practices.
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) ‚Äì Automatic code formatting for consistency.
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ‚Äì A flexible, customizable UI component library.
- **Icons**: [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) ‚Äì Crisp, open-source React icons.

## **Before You Begin**

This template uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the default package manager for faster dependency resolution and disk space efficiency. However, you can switch to `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` if preferred.

### Updataing Package Manager

By default, this template enforces `pnpm`. To use another package manager, follow these steps:

#### 1. Remove `pnpm` Enforcement

Open `package.json` and modify or remove the following lines:

```json
"preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm",
"prebuild": "pnpm run lint"
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies Using Your Preferred Manager

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install  # or yarn install, bun install
```

Now you're ready to start building! üöÄ

## **Getting Started**

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egarrisxn/scribeverse.git my-next-ai-project
cd my-next-ai-project
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### 4. Open in Your Browser

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. TThe page will auto-update as you edit the file. Now, get to building! üöÄ

## **Styling**

This project utilizes [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) alongside [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).

Since Tailwind v4 is still new (as of 2/27), we are using the canary version of the `shadcn/ui` CLI to add components. To install a UI component, run the following command, replacing `[component]` with the actual component name:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]
```

### Updating UI

To customize the base UI colors, you'll need to reconfigure your CSS variables. Run:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@canary init
```

## **Fonts**

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for optimized font loading. By default, it includes [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern typeface by Vercel.

You can easily swap out the font for another one. I recommend using `next/font` for built-in optimization or self-hosting fonts for better performance. Be mindful of font file sizes if sourcing them locally.

## **Metadata**

Since we are using the app router in **Next.js 15**, many metadata-related assets no longer need to be manually defined in the `<Head>` of your layout. Instead, Next.js automatically picks them up when they are placed in the `app` folder.

For example, the following files are already recognized by Next.js:

- **OpenGraph & Twitter images**: `opengraph-image.png` & `twitter-image.png` + alt. txt files.
- **Icons**: `favicon.ico`, `apple-icon.png`, `icon.svg`, & `icon.png`.
- **Manifest**: `manifest.ts`, `manifest.json`, `manifest.webmanifest`, OR `site.webmanifest`.
- **SEO & Crawler files**: `robots.ts` OR `robots.txt` & `sitemap.ts` OR `sitemap.xml`.

### Quick Note

For generating favicons, icons, and a `manifest.json`, I **highly** recommend visiting [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) and using their open-sourced tools.


## **Deployment**

For a seamless deployment experience, use the **Deploy** button below to launch your project on Vercel.

Note: You are not limited to Vercel and may deploy this template on any platform that supports Next.js. However, in my experience, Vercel provides the fastest and most convenient setup.
